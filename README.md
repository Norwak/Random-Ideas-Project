# Random Ideas Project
Express + MongoDB Atlas

A big project from a javascript learning course. Didn't came up with it myself.

When I was coding along with the guy in the course, I tried to make various improvements. List of things I added myself:

- Rewrote Modal class to support more than 1 specific modal.
- Added edit feature for ideas.
- Added fade animations to modals.
- Added spinner to show that idea deletion is in progress.
- Added toast notifications to replace outdated alert messages.
- Various small UI impovements with paddings.
- In finished version of this app from the course some events were bound using event delegation, I changed it to direct binding.
